# Final Project

## The project is an Employee Managment System using Linked list Data Structure

### The Linked List is implemented with the following Functions
1- Insertion at the beginning.

2- Insertion at the End. 

3- Insertion at a certain position.

4- Deletion at the beginning.

5- Deletion at the end.

6- Deletion of a certain node.

7- Deletion by value.

8- Get the number of elements.

9- Reverse the list.

10- Search by value.

11- Edit by Value.

12- Free the list(Delete the whole List).

13- Display the list.

14- Check by value.



## The Employee Managment System has the following Functions 

1- Add an Employee Record.

2- Modify an Employee Record.

3- Delete an Employee Record.

4- View an Employee Record.

5- View All Employees Records.

6- Exits.
